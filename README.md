## FizzBuzz

Write a program that uses *console.log* to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5

## Chessboard

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to *console.log* should show something like this:

```
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #
```

## Recursion

The recursive function `isEven` should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a `Boolean`.

## Bean Counting

Write a function `countBs` that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters there are in the string.

Next, write a function called `countChar` that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite `countBs` to make use of this new function.
